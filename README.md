This is my repo of studying a new programming language Rust. From the basic grammar, types, ownership, ..., and such. 
The main branch of this repo is the root dir of whole folder. And each part of exercises are each sub-folders, titled by folders' name.
Thanks for come here. Everybody can also fork or pull up issues to make it more reasonable and structured for a beginner to learn and exercise.
